## Getting started

Start the server:

```
script/server
```

You can also run the server in detached mode (i.e. without any output to your console):

```
script/server -d
```

Run the setup (first-time run only):

```
script/setup
```

Once the server has started, the following containers will be running:

* WordPress: http://localhost (username/password: `admin`/`admin`)
* MailCatcher: http://localhost:1080
* Beanstalk Console: http://localhost:2080
* MySQL: http://localhost:3306 (username/password: `root`/`foobar`)

For a /bin/sh console running on the WordPress container, run `script/console`
For a MySQL console, run `bin/wp db cli`

## Plugins & Themes

Use [Whippet](https://github.com/dxw/whippet) to manage plugins or external themes.

See the [theme README](wp-content/themes/theme/README.md) for more on how to develop the theme.

TODO: Remove the `README.md` from `wp-content/themes/theme`, and rename `README.example.md` to `README.md`, updating it as needed.
